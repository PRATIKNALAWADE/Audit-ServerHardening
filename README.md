# Security Audit and Hardening Script

---

This script automates security audits and server hardening processes for Linux servers. It performs comprehensive checks, identifies vulnerabilities, and applies hardening measures to improve server security.

## Features

- **User and Group Audits**: List users/groups, check for UID 0 users, and identify users with weak or no passwords.
- **File and Directory Permissions**: Scan for world-writable files/directories and SUID/SGID files.
- **Service Audits**: List running services and check for unnecessary or unauthorized services.
- **Firewall and Network Security**: Verify firewall status, report open ports, and check IP forwarding.
- **IP and Network Configuration Checks**: Identify public vs. private IP addresses.
- **Security Updates and Patching**: Check for available security updates and verify automatic update configurations.
- **Log Monitoring**: Check for suspicious log entries related to SSH.
- **Server Hardening**: Implement SSH key-based authentication, disable IPv6, secure the bootloader, configure the firewall, and set up automatic updates.
- **Custom Security Checks**: Extend the script with custom checks based on specific requirements.
- **Report and Alerting**: Generate a summary report of the audit and hardening process.
